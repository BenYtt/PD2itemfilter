# Item Filter by Sawyer
### It alerts you to great items, shows you good items, and hides bad items

My goal with this filter is a simple and professional display of items. As a player, I want to see an item and make a decision about it instantly.

This filter will require you to view ground items for the "good" (not great) tier items I don't hide (press alt). Missing these items won't be a terrible thing, and I often don't pick them up, but they're available to you as an option.

Additionally, I opt'd to not fully hold your hand as a player on this filter. Some runeword options are listed on gear, but not all. The filter is casual friendly, but if you've never played Diablo 2, you might need to research why certain non-magic items are being displayed with this filter.

I offer this one version, and will help you customize it as you desire. Updates will happen and it is your responsibility to update your copy. No technical support is offered by me. I will only help you with the contents inside of default.filter. If you need help with filter installation or other technical problems, please talk to the *loot filter expert* in #lootfilter channel of [PD2's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RgX4MWu)
